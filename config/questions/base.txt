Which users clicked on these links?

Question 6
Are there any other email senders associated with this activity? What are those email addresses?


Part 2

You were able to capture some of the malware that was downloaded by your users. 
They are obfuscated powershell scripts that attempt to download a new backdoor. 
You have been told to block the delivery urls before any more malware is downloaded.

You must identify the links to the 2nd stage malware samples by deobfuscating the files in the malware folder.

Good luck!
