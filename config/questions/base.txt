Question 1

Several users reported having received suspicious emails from {{ malicious_sender }}. Who receive these emails?

Question 2

Some of these emails were blocked by your spam filters. How many emails from this sender were delivered to users?

Question 3

What domains were used in the links contained in these suspicious emails?

Question 4

Which users clicked on these links?

Question 5

Which IP addresses were asssociated with these links?

Part 2

You were able to capture some of the malware that was downloaded by your users. 
They are obfuscated powershell scripts that attempt to download a new backdoor. 
You have been told to block the delivery urls before any more malware is downloaded.

You must identify the links to the 2nd stage malware samples by deobfuscating the files in the malware folder.

Good luck!
